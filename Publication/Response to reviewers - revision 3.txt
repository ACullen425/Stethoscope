Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Dr. Tarek Loubani and Mahmoud Al-Alawi are affiliated with Glia Inc., a research corporation solely owned and controlled by Dr. Tarek Loubani. The corporation had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis or decision to publish. This affiliation does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Glia Inc., Dr. Tarek Loubani and the authors have no actual, pending or potential patents and no intention to ever patent this or similar work on open medical devices.





Financial Disclosure: The authors received no specific funding for this work. The project was self-funded by Dr. Tarek Loubani. After the completion of the experimental and analytical work described in this paper, Dr. Tarek Loubani was awarded a grant from the University of Western Ontario’s medical school in the Summer Research Training Program. This grant paid Alex Pavlosky a stipend to work with Dr. Tarek Loubani for two summers. Part of this time covered preparation of this manuscript and figures. Dr. Tarek Loubani was also awarded a fellowship with the Shuttleworth Foundation in March 2017. During the latter stages of the preparation of the manuscript (after March 2017), Dr. Tarek Loubani received protected research time funded by the Foundation. This was during the revision phase of the publication process. While Dr. Tarek Loubani and Mahmoud Al-Alawi are affiliated with Glia Inc., this research corporation is solely owned and controlled by Dr. Tarek Loubani, did not exist during the study design, data collection and analysis or decision to publish. It had no role in funding or decisionmaking for any members of the project for the duration of the above. While Glia Inc. existed during the preparation of the manuscript, the corporation had no role in manuscript preparation. Since March 2017, Glia Inc. has paid a salary to Mahmoud Al-Alawi for his work researching and manufacturing medical devices. The funding for Glia Inc. is presently provided by Dr. Tarek Loubani and by the Shuttleworth Foundation.

6. PLOS requires that you differentiate heading levels by font size only. Please modify your submission so that different heading levels are clearly indicated by different font sizes. See our formatting guidelines for further information: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf



7. Please modify the headings in your manuscript so that they are not written in all capital letters or all italics. Acronyms, gene or species names, etc. can be in capitals or italics.
